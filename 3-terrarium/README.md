# My Terrarium: A project to learn about HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript üåµüå±

A small drag and drop code-meditation. With a little HTML, JS and CSS, you will be able to build a web interface, style it, and even add multiple interactions of your choice.

The terrarium created via CSS was inspired by Jakub Mandra's glass jar [codepen](https://codepen.io/Rotarepmi/pen/rjpNZY).

The artwork is hand drawn by [Jen Looper](http://jenlooper.com) with the help of Procreate.

## Deploy your Terrarium

You can deploy, or publish your terrarium on the web using Azure Static Web Apps. 

1. Fork this repo

2. Press this button

[![Deploy to Azure button](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false&WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon#create/Microsoft.StaticApp)

3. Walk through the wizard creating your app. Make sure you set the app root to either be `/solution` or the root of your codebase. There's no API in this app, so don't worry about adding that. A github folder will be created in your forked repository that will help Azure Static Web Apps' build services, build and publish your app to a new URL.
